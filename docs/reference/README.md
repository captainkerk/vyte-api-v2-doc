# Introduction

> This page will help you get started with Vyte. You'll be up and running in a minute! The API will let you integrate Vyte into your application.

The API provides useful functionalities such as:

1. Create events in Vyte directly from your app
  1. You will first need to register as a "third party" app in Vyte (through an endpoint)
  2. Then you'll be able to link to Vyte to schedule an event with all the members of a team, project, task (we call that a "group")
  3. You'll be able to retrieve all the events related to that group
2. Link to a Vyte page and pass parameters in the URL
